We have to define and implement a database application using Firebird DBMS, which consists in a relational system and open source. This project includes a investigation about the explicit firebird lock system (use the WITH LOCK clause with appropriate justifications) and about the connection parameters which affects the concorrency control executed by this lock. The final document to be delivered should contain a section about the the full functionality of this firebird lock system and about how these functionalities can be modified by certain choices fr the connection parameters.
